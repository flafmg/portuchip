# PortuCHIP
An emulator for CHIP-8 written in Portugol Studio and Lua

## Introduction
PortuCHIP is a fun project where I created a CHIP-8 emulator using Portugol Studio and Lua. Portugol Studio is a language designed to teach the basics of programming in portuguese, not to create emulators/interpreters :p.

## Features
- Written in **Portugol Studio** and **Lua**.
- Includes a Lua script to extract ROM bytes into text for Portugol to read and convert to integers.
- The emulator has some minor errors.

## Usage
Download [Portugol Studio](https://univali-lite.github.io/Portugol-Studio/) to execute the script and use the provided Lua script to extract bytes from the ROM to text so that Portugol can read and convert the text to integers. (portugol cant read the bytes of a file =/)
